          <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p class="mb-0"><em>&mdash; "As long as you as an individual... can convince yourself that in order to move forward as best you can you have to be optimistic, you can be described as 'one of the faithful,' one of those people who can say, 'Well, look, something's going to happen! Let's just keep trying. Let's not give up."</em><p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><em>&mdash; "Truth is, I'll never know all there is to know about you just as you will never know all there is to know about me. Humans are by nature too complicated to be understood fully. So, we can choose either to approach our fellow human beings with suspicion or to approach them with an open mind, a dash of optimism and a great deal of candour."</em></p>
            <p><em>&mdash; "I understand the concept of optimism. But I think with me what you get is a lack of cynicism."</em></p>
